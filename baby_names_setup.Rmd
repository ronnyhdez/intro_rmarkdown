A good place to start learning R and the tidyverse is the weekly social data
project [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Every
week a new dataset is release to be analyzed by the R community. Here we are
going to use some examples created by the community and shared by twitter and
GitHub with the __Baby Names__ dataset from the week 12, 2022.

## Baby Names dataset

This data set comes from Hadley Wickham's `{babynames}` package. The package contains three datasets provided by the US Social Security Administration (SSA)

- `babynames`: The number of children of each sex given each name (1880 - 2017). Only includes names used >5 times.   
- `applicants`: The number of applicants for social security numbers, for each year, for each sex.  
- `lifetables`: Cohort life tables data. 

## Objectives

 - Find the most popular name (female and male) in each generation.
 - Explore how each name's popularity has changed across the generations (1901 - 2017).  

## Methods

Given that the original data sets do not have the generation, it was necessary to
include the definitions suggested by the [Pew Research Centre](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins).

Next, the top male and female name for each generation was extracted. **Top** was
define as the name with the highest **number** of people called that name in a
generation. Then two data sets (one for female, one for male) were created to
show the most popular names.

```{r generation classification}
# Assign each year to a generation. Drop years before 1901.
baby_usa_1901_onwards <- babynames_usa %>% 
  filter(year >= 1901) %>% 
  mutate(generation = case_when(
    between(year, 1901, 1927) ~ "Greatest Generation",
    between(year, 1928, 1945) ~ "Silent Generation",
    between(year, 1946, 1964) ~ "Baby Boomer",
    between(year, 1965, 1980) ~ "Generation X",
    between(year, 1981, 1996) ~ "Millennial",
    between(year, 1997, 2012) ~ "Generation Z",
    between(year, 2013, 2025) ~ "Alpha"
  ))

# Create a quick generation summary table
# Looks like there is more diversity in names amongst the most recent generations 
# (remember we're only in the middle of Alpha)
